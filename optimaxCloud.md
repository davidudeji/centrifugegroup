# PROJECT SPECIFICATION

## Integrating OptimaXCloud into the Centrifuge Group Website

### 1. PROJECT OBJECTIVE

Act as a senior frontend engineer, enterprise SaaS designer, information architect, technical copywriter, and SEO specialist.

Integrate OptimaXCloud into the existing Centrifuge Group corporate website as a fully developed cloud services and infrastructure product section.

Primary product website:
https://be.optimaxsuites.com/iaas/xcw/index.html

Existing corporate website:
https://www.centrifugegroup.com/

Existing corporate cloud services page:
https://www.centrifugegroup.com/cloud-services/

The objective is to make OptimaXCloud discoverable through the main navigation and footer while giving it a professional, technically credible, and commercially compelling presentation.

Do not build an isolated microsite with unrelated branding.

The new pages must feel like a natural extension of the existing Centrifuge Group website.

### 2. NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS

1. Inspect the existing website and codebase before making changes.
2. Preserve all existing pages, routes, navigation items, functionality, and integrations.
3. Reuse the existing design system, brand assets, typography, spacing conventions, header, and footer.
4. Do not replace the corporate website's identity with a generic cloud-provider template.
5. Build a connected, multi-page OptimaXCloud section rather than forcing all information onto one page.
6. Add the OptimaXCloud entry to the primary navigation and footer.
7. Ensure every internal navigation link works.
8. Use Framer Motion if it is already available in the project. If the project uses a different established animation system, reuse it instead of introducing unnecessary dependencies.
9. Use responsive, accessible components.
10. Do not invent product capabilities, customer endorsements, security certifications, uptime guarantees, provider partnerships, or production integrations.
11. Clearly distinguish confirmed capabilities from planned integrations.
12. Preserve the existing website's business purpose and corporate messaging.
13. Do not introduce fake dashboards, fake testimonials, fabricated performance metrics, or misleading infrastructure diagrams.
14. Use the existing logo files wherever possible.
15. Do not publish the changes until the routes, links, responsive layouts, and primary interactions have been tested.

If the source code is available, modify the existing project directly. Do not recreate the entire website from scratch.

# 4. BRANDING AND DESIGN DIRECTION

## 4.1 Design principle

The visual direction is:

Enterprise technology with a clear corporate identity.

The experience should feel:

- Professional.
- Reliable.
- Modern.
- Technical without being intimidating.
- Structured and easy to scan.
- Consistent with the existing Centrifuge Group website.

Use the current corporate website as the source of truth for branding.

Do not invent a replacement Centrifuge logo or change the established corporate identity.

## 4.2 Color system

Inspect the existing logo, CSS variables, design tokens, and page backgrounds before selecting colors.

Reuse the existing brand palette.

Create an OptimaXCloud accent system only if needed to distinguish the product within the corporate website.

Possible supporting colors include:

- Deep navy for technical emphasis.
- White or the existing light background for content sections.
- Neutral gray for secondary information.
- One restrained accent color derived from the existing brand.

These are design directions, not authorization to override the existing brand palette.

Use the same colors consistently across all OptimaXCloud pages.

## 4.3 Typography

Use the existing corporate typography.

Establish a consistent hierarchy for:

- Hero headlines.
- Page titles.
- Section headings.
- Body copy.
- Supporting labels.
- Buttons.
- Breadcrumbs.
- Technical metadata.

Avoid oversized headings that consume too much vertical space.

Use readable line lengths and generous but consistent spacing.

## 4.4 Layout and spacing

Use a consistent content container and responsive grid.

The site should feature:

- Strong alignment.
- Clear section separation.
- Balanced whitespace.
- Consistent card spacing.
- Carefully controlled text widths.
- Consistent button sizing.
- Responsive image and illustration ratios.

Avoid excessive rounded cards, gradients, decorative glass effects, and floating elements that conflict with the existing brand.

## 4.5 Motion and interaction

Use restrained, purposeful motion.

If Framer Motion is available, use it for:

- Hero content entrance.
- Subtle section reveals.
- Small transitions between navigation states.
- Integration diagram reveals.
- Accordion expansion.
- Mobile menu transitions.

Animations should remain smooth and subtle.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Do not animate every element independently.

Avoid scroll hijacking, long introductory animations, and interactions that interfere with accessibility.

---

# 5. PRIMARY NAVIGATION

Add OptimaXCloud to the existing primary navigation.

Do not remove existing navigation items.

Recommended hierarchy:

Home
About
Services
Solutions
OptimaXCloud
Projects
Insights
Contact

Adapt these labels to the actual existing navigation structure instead of forcing a new arrangement.

## OptimaXCloud dropdown

Use a clean enterprise dropdown or mega-menu that matches the existing navigation design.

The dropdown should contain:

OPTIMAXCLOUD

Cloud infrastructure and application operations.

Overview
Platform
Integrations
Solutions
Migration
Pricing
Documentation

Primary action:
Explore OptimaXCloud

Secondary action:
Request a Consultation

Do not add a product logo to the dropdown unless the brand system already supports one.

If the existing navigation uses a wide dropdown, preserve its interaction pattern.

Requirements:

- Open on hover for pointer devices where appropriate.
- Support click and keyboard interaction.
- Close on Escape.
- Close when clicking outside.
- Support touch devices.
- Use correct ARIA attributes.
- Maintain visible focus indicators.
- Avoid layout shifts.
- Ensure the menu does not obscure critical navigation controls.
- Provide a clear active state for the current OptimaXCloud page.

The menu must not become inaccessible on mobile.

Include these links:

- Overview
- Platform
- Integrations
- Solutions
- Cloud Migration
- Pricing
- Documentation

Add a concise product description:

"Explore cloud infrastructure, application deployment, and managed cloud services from Centrifuge Group."

Include the existing corporate contact information and established legal links.

Do not invent new support email addresses or telephone numbers.

Use the corporate website's existing contact details.

The footer must:

- Remain responsive.
- Preserve the existing social links.
- Preserve legal and company links.
- Use accessible link contrast.
- Avoid duplicate or broken navigation entries.

# 18. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

Inspect the existing repository and identify:

- Framework and version.
- Routing system.
- Existing page components.
- Header and footer components.
- CSS architecture.
- Design tokens.
- Existing animation dependencies.
- Existing contact form integration.
- Existing SEO implementation.
- Build and deployment workflow.

Then implement the new pages using the established architecture.

Create reusable components where appropriate:

- OptimaXCloudHero.
- CloudCapabilityCard.
- CloudWorkflow.
- IntegrationCard.
- IntegrationArchitecture.
- WorkloadCard.
- MigrationStep.
- PricingPlan.
- DocumentationCard.
- CloudCTA.
- Breadcrumbs.

Avoid duplicating the header or footer.

Keep page content in structured, maintainable components or data files when appropriate.

Use semantic HTML and avoid unnecessary dependencies.

Do not introduce a second CSS framework if the existing project already has a consistent styling system.

Do not modify unrelated pages unless a shared navigation or footer update requires it.

# 19. CONTENT ACCURACY AND GOVERNANCE

Before publication, classify all product claims into three categories.

### Category A — Verified current capabilities

Only use this label when the implementation or approved product owner confirms that the capability is available.

### Category B — Documented integration or implementation approach

Use wording such as:

- Designed to support.
- The documented integration approach.
- Intended workflow.
- Available subject to configuration.
- Contact us to confirm availability.

### Category C — Planned capabilities

Use wording such as:

- Planned.
- Under development.
- Roadmap item.

Do not market planned capabilities as production-ready.

Do not invent:

- Uptime percentages.
- Service-level agreements.
- Security certifications.
- Compliance status.
- Customer counts.
- Performance benchmarks.
- Availability regions.
- Provider partnerships.
- Support response times.
- Backup retention periods.
- Disaster recovery guarantees.

Use the original product documentation and approved corporate information as the source of truth.

## DEFINITION OF DONE

The task is complete when OptimaXCloud is integrated into the existing Centrifuge Group website as a coherent, responsive, accessible, and internally connected product section.

The result must preserve the existing corporate identity while providing enough detail for visitors to understand the product, explore its technical capabilities, evaluate the available services, review indicative pricing, and contact Centrifuge Group.

Do not stop after creating the landing page.

Implement all seven pages, navigation changes, footer changes, internal links, and required quality checks.
